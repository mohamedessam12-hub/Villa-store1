Repository Description E-Commerce APIs - Built with ASP.NET Web APIs And Mvc For View 
This project is a robust web application built with a focus on modularity and scalability.
It features an API layer designed with authentication mechanisms that use token-based authentication to ensure secure access.
The API is versioned, allowing support for multiple versions, which makes it future-proof and flexible for updates.                                                                                                                              

The application leverages design patterns like the Repository Pattern to handle data access efficiently and uses AutoMapper for smooth object mapping between layers. 
On the front-end, the project incorporates an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, which serves as the primary user interface. 
The MVC layer communicates with the API by sending requests and displaying the received data dynamically.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
This design not only separates concerns between the API and the front-end but also ensures a seamless user experience and maintainability. 
The project demonstrates best practices in software development, combining scalability, security, and clean architecture.
